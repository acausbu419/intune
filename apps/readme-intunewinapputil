Open powershell as admin.

Navigate to your working folder e.g. 'cd c:\users\username\documents\intune
Call your file with the command line arguments above where:
    -c is your source folder for all the package files
    -s is your source file that will be referenced during the package installation
    -o is your output folder

After a successful run you should see a install.intunewin file was generated in the current folder.
Rename the file to something more descriptive e.g. visuwell.intunewin

Now you should be able to import & test the package with Intune's web app.
